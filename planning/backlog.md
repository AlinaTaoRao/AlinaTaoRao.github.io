# Backlog

This backlog shows user stories for Alina's project. I organized these stories
inside 3 priorities level you are not necessarily in order.

## Must-Haves

As a layman user, I can navigate comfortably the home page.

- [ ] _there is a navbar_
- [ ] _there is a footer_
- [ ] _there is a logo on top of the page_
- [ ] _there is a paragraph explaining the purpose on the page_

As a student in web-development, I can find various contacts in the home page
and future digital entrepreneur. So that:

- I can get a possibility to collaborate with other students in open source
  projects
- I can contact coaches and experts to get help from them
- I can follow them on social media
- I can found useful resources to expand my skills in coding.
- I can found addresses of free online platforms to learn coding.

As a coach (mentor) in web-development, I can see what a student in
web-development has learned so far. So that:

- I can guide and help her/him.
- I can enter in contact with her/him.
- I can see her/his social media links.
