# Design

The design that I propose is based on the different interviews I ran. The design
aims to create a matching between the needs from the users and the stakeholder.
The stakeholder wants to show her competencies, share information and be in
contact with students and professionals from the digital field.

Following what I captured, I designed the homepage that is attractive,
responsive and easy to navigate.

The navigation bar, the logo and the body are not overloaded. Since the
stakeholder aims to show what she knows, her skills and she looks to expand her
network, I thought the homepage does not need a lot of pictures.

I opted for a pure design.

<!-- give an overview of your project's design -->
<!-- describe the reasoning behind your group's design and wireframe -->
<!-- include other centralized decisions like fonts, palates, ... -->
