  ,you don't need to ask for approve of run workflow.
- When create a PR, try to link it to the issue.

## make a good communication plan

- 1st meeting, create a task list or turn tasks into issues and set assignee.
- At the end of the meeting, confirm of the topic of the next meeting
- try to meeting every day, even if 5 min.
