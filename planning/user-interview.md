## User interview

### My questions and the user's answers I noted

1 - **When you visit my homepage, what do you look first?**

What I look first are pictures and the navigation bar.

2 - **What are the information that you find not useful in any junior developer
homepage?**

I do not have a right answer. Because I have not visited many junior
web-developer homepages yet. I have only visited few junior web-developer
homepages. And I found them quite attractive. The design was nice. I noticed
that they had navigation bars, social media icons and pictures.

3- **Do you pay attention to design when you visit a webpage?**

Yes. For me, the design is the most important. It counts for 100%. If I do not
find the design of a homepage attractive, I will stop visiting the website.

4 - **Do you give up easily when you face any difficulty?**

It depends on the situation. But most of the times, I try to resolve issues that
I face.

5 - **What do you think about Open source?**

In my opinion, Open source is a good idea because people in different locations
around the world can work together. With Open source, everyone can access to the
source and contribute.

6 - **What are your criteria in terms of job opportunities?** **Do you pay more
attention to what aspect of a job announcement?**

First, the missions of the position. Secondly, The location. Thirdly, the skills
and implications that the job requires. Fourth, I ask to myself if I am
interested in the job. Fifth, the salary.

The salary is the last aspect because as a junior web-developer, I do not have
enough professional experience at the moment.

7 - **Do you like working in team or alone?**

I like working in team in the big projects. I like also working alone when the
task or project is not big. I am used to working in team. Before HYF, I often
worked in team in a laboratory.

8 - **What is you fear concerning professional career?**

I am apprehensive about working overtime. I am afraid of overtime.

9 - **What is your next project?**

To build my homepage.

### Notes during the interview with the user

_See answers above._

### The summary after the interview with the user

Alina works hard to accomplish what she believes in. She believes that Open
source is a good idea because it allows free collaboration and sharing. This
fits in with her philosophy of life in general. As she likes working in team. As
far as job opportunities are concerned, she focuses more on the tasks and
missions of the job/position than on the salary. For her, gaining work
experience is more important.

### Follow-Up Interview with the user

I presented the summary of the first interview to Alina. She agreed with the
summary I made and confirmed her answers.

### 2nd notes during the interview with the user

What can impede/block Alina to use a webpage are:

- Loud music
- Very bright colors (because they cause pain in eyes)
- A lot of contents (not easy to read)
- External links
- Notifications from webpage
- Cookies
- Advertises. Except if the advertise can make her feel happy or bring joyce.

### 2nd summary after the interview with the user

Alina focuses less on the porto-folio when she visits a homepage of a Junior
Developer. Because she is not an employer. She focuses more on the design
(buttons, headers, navigation bar, etc.).
